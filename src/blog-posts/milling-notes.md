I hope to flesh out this section with a lot more details that I've learned over the years, but a few basic points to leave here:

Freshly milling grain greatly increases flavor, just like grinding fresh coffee! Its a game changer for baking. It also produces grain that has some different properties from store-bought whole wheat flour. It is often more "thirsty", i.e. it takes more liquid to flour ratio to achieve similar results.  

I use a [Mock Mill Professional 200](https://mockmill.us/product/mockmill-professional-200-stone-grain-mill/?srsltid=AfmBOoqnCAlQNWhbbVZj8rN3lzeHAXStfGblq4hfJC052tH6ZIBBybQb) to mill grain, and am curious about a potential mid-size countertop mill from New American Stone Mills that they have teased on their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCUeBzzPLX1/?igsh=ZG9vZ2Q2d2Vxa2g3).  

The mockmill's small stone size means that it heats the grain up significantly as it mills. In order to keep the proteins and enzymes in the grain intact, I try to keep the flour temperature below 95 degrees Fahrenheit while milling. For best results with a mill with small stones, I freeze the grain I intend to mill the night before, and mill it in two passes: a coarse pass and a fine pass.

# A Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning

Machine learning is transforming every industry. This guide will help you understand the basics and get started.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Learning from labeled training data to make predictions on new data.

### Unsupervised Learning
Finding hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.

### Reinforcement Learning
Learning through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties.

## Getting Started

Start with Python and libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. Practice with real datasets and gradually work your way up to more complex problems.

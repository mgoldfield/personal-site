I have learned that grain varietals have vastly differing taste and baking properties! In combination with milling fresh grain, a new world of flavor and texture is opened through this exploration. I try to source grain from farms near where I live in Western Massachusetts. As much as I and others try to categorize grains, different grains, or even the same grain from different farms can have significant differences. Below are some grains, flours, and other things I've tried and I'm slowly adding notes when I can.  

I've been introduced to many wonderful local-ish farms via the [Pioneer Valley Grain CSA](https://localgrain.org/), though I generally source from them directly now.  I've tried to note local farms where I can.  When I don't buy locally, I've often bought from [Breadtopia](https://breadtopia.com/product-category/grains-flours/whole-berries/) which has excellent quality standards and variety.

## Wheats

### Red Fife
One of my favorite flavored wheats - a red wheat great for baking. Its a little softer than Redeemer or Aurora, but has an exceptional flavor. Also have had great success with adding Red Fife to pie crusts. I have sourced from [Maine Grains](https://mainegrains.com/) who have excellent but expensive products. I've also sourced from Breadtopia.

### Aurora 1109
A strong red wheat with great baking properties. Has kind of a grape-nuts bran-like flavor. Its descended from a varietal developed at the WSU BreadLab and is now cultivated by [Nitty Gritty Grain](https://www.nittygrittygrain.com/findus) which is who I source from

### Redeemer
Redeemer is another strong red wheat I've sourced from a few farms nearby. Most similar alternative to Yecora Rojo, but a little more flavorful, which is a good thing!

### Red Lammas
A wonderful winter-wheat-strength red wheat, that was cultivated from a small amount of seed by Lazy Acres farm in Hatfield MA. I believe they were the only cultivator of this wheat in North America. They have since stopped cultivating this wheat, which is a real bummer, it was similar to red fife in deliciousness and strength, and was wonderful to have so near my home. I have a little left and am savoring it.  [Read more](https://www.wheat-gateway.org.uk/hub.php?ID=22) for some interesting history...

### Yecora Rojo
A strong west coast wheat, buttery flavor. Adds strong elasticity. I have bought it primarily from Breadtopia. Very yummy and mild, but I've tried to move away from it in order to be more local to the northeast. See Redeemer, Aurora 1109 as excellent alternatives.

### Sonora
A white wheat named for Sonora, Mexico, and famous for tortilla making. Excellent as a base for making whole wheat pastries. Also adds extensibility to dough. I've bought this from Breadtopia

### Warthog
Nutty and mild, a lovely wheat. I haven't found great sources of this after the farm I was sourcing from (I believe was called north star) closed :(

### Sirvinta
A Lithuanian heritage wheat variety known for its excellent baking properties and distinct nutty flavor. It performs well in both breads and pastries, with moderate protein content that provides good structure without becoming too tough. Some say it has the flavor of buttered popcorn...

### Edison
A hard white spring wheat developed by Washington State University, named after Edison, WA. Known for excellent protein content (typically 13-14%) and exceptional flavor. It produces a creamy colored flour that works wonderfully in artisan breads, creating a golden crust and open crumb structure. I've tried this a bit but its tough to get in bulk affordably on the east coast.  

## Rye
A diverse and complex grain that adds distinctive flavor and moisture retention to breads. Rye contains different proteins than wheat, resulting in less gluten formation and denser breads. It has a deep, earthy flavor that can range from mild to robust depending on the variety and growing conditions. Particularly excellent for sourdough breads and traditional European-style baking, and pairs beautifully with chocolate. 

## Spelt
An ancient grain related to modern wheat, with a nutty, slightly sweet flavor. It contains gluten but is often more digestible for some people who have wheat sensitivities (though not for those with celiac disease). The gluten in spelt is more delicate than modern wheat, requiring gentle handling during mixing, but adds extensibility to doughs with stronger wheat. 

## Einkorn
The oldest known cultivated wheat variety, with a rich, nutty flavor and golden color. It's higher in protein and minerals than modern wheat, though lower in gluten content. The gluten structure is very different from modern wheat, making it tricky to work with in traditional bread recipes. Excellent as an addition to stronger wheat or where gluten structure is less important.  

## Emmer
Also known as farro medio, this ancient grain has a rich, complex flavor with hints of nuts and earth. It contains less gluten than modern wheat but more protein and minerals. The gluten structure is weaker, making it best suited for flatbreads and crackers when used alone, or as a flavor enhancer when combined with stronger wheats. It creates beautiful rustic breads with a tight but tender crumb.  I source from [Small Valley Milling](https://smallvalleymilling.com/shop/)

## Rice
While not typically a bread grain, rice flour adds interesting textural elements to baked goods. It can be add tenderness, chewiness, and flavor to wheat breads as a porridge. Different varieties of rice contribute different flavors and properties to the final product.

Rice flour can also be used to dust bannetons for easier release of high-hydration doughs, because it doesn't easily stick to the wheat flours. In the dough itself, a small percentage (5-10%) can help create a more tender crumb. 

### Koji porridge
Rice that has been inoculated with koji spores can be lovely addition to bread. When added to bread dough as a porridge, it introduces enzymes that break down starches into sugars, creating complex toasty caramel-y flavors and improving keeping quality.  I first saw a recipe for this in Tartine Book No. 3.

## Flours

### Cairnspring Mills
[Cairnspring website](https://cairnspring.com/)

#### Trailblazer
A versatile bread flour with excellent protein content and performance. I've been trying out out as a base flour to blend stronger flavors into.  I usually use KA Special Patent flour in this role, and I'm trying out something thats stone ground, with good results.

#### Expresso
A high-extraction bread flour that provides a deeper flavor but also not so strong that its not worth blending with other whole wheat grains.  

### Farmer Ground
A New York-based mill producing organic, stone-milled flours.  Their high extraction bread flour has a strong warm nutty flavor and is good on its own, but not ideal for blending with its already strong flavor.  

### King Arthur
[King Arthur website](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/)

#### Patent Special (bulk version of King Arthur Bread Flour)
A consistent, reliable high-protein flour perfect for bread baking. Creates strong gluten development and reliable results. Protein content typically around 12.7%.

#### Organic Bread Flour
Similar to Patent Special but organic, with excellent performance and consistency. Works well in all bread applications.

#### Sir Lancelot
Their highest protein flour (14.2%), excellent for bagels and other high-protein applications. Creates very strong gluten development and chewy texture.

## Also of note, but not technically grains

### Buckwheat
Despite its name, buckwheat is actually a seed related to rhubarb. It has a distinctive earthy, nutty flavor that can be quite intense. When freshly milled, it has beautiful blue-gray specs. Excellent in pancakes and as a flavoring grain in breads. Contains no gluten, so must be combined with wheat flour for traditional bread baking. Particularly wonderful in combination with rye.

### Corn
While not typically used as a primary bread grain, corn adds wonderful flavor and texture when included in small proportions. Fresh-milled corn as well as masa (nixtamalized ground corn) can add wonderful sweet flavors. Works particularly well in porridge breads and adds texture to crusts when used as a dusting flour.

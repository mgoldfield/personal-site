Hello! My name is Matt Goldfield. I work on projects centered around
data, distributed systems, music, and combinations of those topics. I
like thinking about how humans collaborate and build relationships, and
about work and housing coops. I sometimes play and record music, and I
cook and bake a lot. 

I'm currently a software engineer at [iZotope](https://www.izotope.com/). 

Various current and past software projects, including a (now inactive)
simple in-browser DAW called [LoopMagic!](https://github.com/mgoldfield/nodelooper). 

I sometimes make records with [Anat Halevy Hochberg](https://www.anathalevyhochberg.com/)
under our duet [Cap and Scarf](https://elulmusicproject.bandcamp.com/). 

From 2008-2015 I played in the rock band [The Rationales](https://therationales.bandcamp.com/).

I'm somewhat obsessed with cooking, especially smoking and curing,
fermenting, bread, pizza, noodles, and dumplings. Here are a few [creations](https://photos.app.goo.gl/SdtHzGY2h6QRuHKm6).
